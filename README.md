# hello

Looking to program something about how to teach someone to teach some subject fast

Would be cool to teach people to teach people to meditate effortlessly and fast

## How to teach meditation.

Break meditation to easily relatable and understandable terms and explain how they are logically connected.

Make the task so easy and effortless, that the participant never feels like someone requires resources from them.

Gradually increase the number of concepts and their interelation to participants, in such a fashion, that it never feels like too much. If the user get's bored after two minutes, the app needs to recognize and offer a way out.

Program should be used in completely voluntary fashion, were the participant feels that whatever effort they make, is really paid in actual learning.

Encourage positive learning experiences and feeling rewarded by the learning.

The subject should feel no pressure from the teaching material to do something in particular.

Be ethically commited to providing actual good information. f.e.

1. how to recognize addictions and addictive behaviours, and understand the optimal process how to change the harmful behaviour.
2. how to create positive habits such as stretching, meditating, exercising, body maintenance exercises, that are known to improve human life and the experience of it.
3. Don't teach ethics, teach people how to teach ethics.
   1. produce some semantic network that can be studied with flash cards with optimal intervals and workloads?
   2. This teaching program could honestly take only minutes of a persons day, and you could teach people aristolean value ethics (or what ever good character traits you were supposed to excell at.)




## Some dumb app ideas you can steal from me. I'll contribute for free anyway.

app plays small sound when meditators mind wander and the person doesn't they are thinking.

You are a true wizard if you can do this with just a phone.

The current best version requires an seriously expensive brain scanner and quite good computing power to get working. Please do this with a phone for me.
